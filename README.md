# Beta Regression
Computes the regression beta (coefficient of OLS) of credit vs equities for different time periods. 
## Description
The betas coefficients provide the hedge amounts to immunise movements in different credit instruments with liquid equities like SPX or NDQ. The output is a useful risk summary for traders to understand the main factors that drive the P&L of the overall portfolio.
